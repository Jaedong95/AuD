i am sad for both of them and i hope something changes for the better
it feels like all i ever achieve through what for me feels like a herculean effort to not feel unhappy is that i break even and barely
so yet again i lose the person that i tell everything to and makes me feel better when i am depressed
i need to realize i am unhappy for no reason
i don't feel like i've done anything to make anyone proud of me in a long time and nobody but reddit knows i am depressed
family is kind of nuts but not extremely horrible got a great girlfriend and of course like you i am depressed
i want to be alone but i am lonely
it can be hard to consider depression the culprit when you don't specifically feel sad but it's possible it's hiding behind the numbness
remember that if you must dwell dwell on what it is making you feel depressed rather than depression itself
it's ok to feel sad and depressed and it's ok to cry
hi im not sure if i am depressed but life just feels kind of shit
they know i am depressed but they act as though it's just a stupid cry for attention
usually the normal things i am lonely i have few friends i waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant a girlfriend etc
my family is really worried about this situation tbh and i really feel sad about it
worst of all is i am sad about that but i am also ok with it
 the other way i explain it is you don't just feel sad you feel fucking tired
barely anything will makr me feel sad for anyone else
i mean i haven't actually told my boyfriend that i think i am depressed or that i have selfesteem issues and he doesn't suspect a thing
lately i've found that i am unhappy with where i am at in my job and personal relationships
and of course i failed why else will i be here see i don't have a lot of friends and i often feel lonely
i am still anxious about it as any one would be but not nearly as much as i was and now i just feel depressed about it
i point to myself as an example of how adopted kids can turn out okay but i am depressed suicidal and a financial and emotional burden on my family
