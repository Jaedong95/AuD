The dish-washing family? You mean the husband who does the dishes? Kiki.
My boss is bothering me a lot.
So I told him to break up with me and play as many games as he wants
"Instead, I got a 20 million won loan from my mother, paid it back in two years, delayed it by a year, and saved the groom 3,000 won"
Let's just say that.
I can't do the rest
"I'm half-hearted, too."
"I'm always at war, LOL"
"Kiki, are you going to do that? Riding a kiln?"
I don't think so
What do you mean? I just met someone else
All couples are good only for newlywed couples. Kiki.
I think it'll be two years before Kiki gets married
I think I got married really well
So I'm going to watch it this week
"Uh, Kiki bowl set for 2 people Stainless steel tableware so I don't think I need to bring it. Kiki"
You guys have a lot of nerve
** You can change it
You'll win.
Then I really want to go
Kiki dog fight. Kiki is so funny. It's fun
I'm going to the beach today. Do you want to go?
I often boil spoons at home too. Kiki
"Yes, soccer's strengths"
I don't like soccer. I'm not interested
Do you have lessons with me?
I'm working. I'm running all day
"Me too! Especially, you need to take care of your mental health"
"It's cheap if it's 15,000 won for 6 months"
Totally! I like it
But I want to be the CEO of Mirae. I need to learn
"The more people there are, the better"
"Oh, Kiki. If you're in Busan now, you can go there often"
Can't you just not dye your hair?
Satisfaction is happiness
Why do you hate it? It's overwhelming
"Kiki, it's winter now, so I'll work hard on it"
Just make it straight?
Buy it if you need it!
What do you mean... Smash the ice cream
Not necessarily.
It's a cost of saving time
I always put on Kiki scrub and moisturizing cream
Do you want to get counseling with me? Kiki.
I lost so much hair after I had a baby
"My hair is long now, so I don't see any bad texture."
Can I buy soap?
"Kiki, that style will be fixed"
Did you eat breakfast and lunch?
"Yes, one pack a day starts from yesterday."
What if you feel dizzy after eating only tofu?
I'm going to take the TOEIC test this time!
Do you remember the club room when you went to school?
I think it's going to be so hard for school teachers these days
"But since middle school, I was a city kid"
"When I was young, I couldn't hear the teachers talking"
"Yes, it changed so much that I was confused at first."
"When I was in high school, I had fun hanging out with my friends after school"
A ceiling crane?
I'm going to go to an English academy
Is that a relief?
"Every time I go, I don't study, I just drink"
That's true.
"Whether it's an indirect experience, I think it would be good to do it in advance in high school."
"When I learned how to play the piano, I took a test and I hated it as if I was studying Kiki's writing Kiki."
I'm a second year cyber university student
"Still, the difficulty level of the test questions varies from school to school, but if you don't know the name of the school, isn't it beneficial for students who have easy problems?"
So did I.
I'm just going to start with a light novel or essay
"They know there's a physical exam, too"
"It's not a lot, but... It's a special case, so we run a separate arrest team"
You said you don't have any friends
Then the lyrics in Private's letter will disappear into history
"During the training, I was able to get my grades up to 5th place"
How much was your monthly salary?
Will you stop saying that it's someone else's problem?
I never want to go
I don't know. I won't let you go because there's not much left
Which part did you like?
"Yes, look at that. Kiki."
I'm communicating with the other units by code
I touched a painful wound  Kiki.
Kiki is not my style. I like small muscles.
I hope it gets better soon.
They're all precious children.
"Yeah, I have to do something to pass the time"
"Yes, I'm glad to hear that. My driving skills were good because I drove it every day"
It would be funny to see them do it
Oh really? I've never played MapleStory
Is it a game where Crazy Arcade and Star compare?
"That's right. Since the technology is getting better, there are a lot of games that are more fun visually, so there's nothing we can do."
When was the last time you played a game?
I think the item game is fun
Are you preparing to be a Battleground pro gamer?
Hold on. I need to talk to my wife
"Right, I lost track of time and did it for 4 hours yesterday"
About 5 million won so far?
"If I don't play games, I watch TV"
I think I get tired of it easily
I'll save my friends from dying
I'm Baecci! So cute
"A fan pretended to shake hands and gave scissors, and Faker reacted to it and gave rock"
I spent a lot of money there. LOL
"I like cute games, too!"
"Yes, that's right. My friends all did it, too"
"Yes, I'll try my best"
I asked my friend to work at a part-time company and he hired me as an intern
"No, I don't"
The time has come when it's impossible to even buy a house with a salary man... Whoo!
"Yes, I didn't get in trouble. Kiki is a baby because he's early 20 years old"
"Ah, which team is mixed with Kiki? Are you all girls?"
They want to change it because it's too sour
There's no distinction between work and rest
"Even if you get sick of it, you have to go and eat snacks in the beginningDistrict"
"Yes, so I feel uncomfortable even if I get promoted."
Why are you doing this when you're not even drunk?
"Haha, I see. Because there are many people who refuse?"
My mom and sister are watching me I feel pressured
Packaging and washing dishes? It's like a hard part-time job
I usually wake up at 8:20
I heard company dinners are an extension of work
"If you want to buy it, Team Leader...Just soap"
You'll be able to finish it quickly with a positive mind
Kiki is rich in hobbies
"I mean, Kiki cod has been digging up daeprika and planting trees You know, Kiki wants to lower the temperature in the summer"
"I should take a rest and go out for a walk. Haha, it's sunny"
"I want to be a villager there, too"
"Right. I think so, too."
Really?
How will the weather be tomorrow?
Your body fat percentage is low.
Can I have two?
I know. I want to have a warm latte.
"Wow, I don't know why winter has come and this year has passed..."
"No, I think it's warmer than yesterday"
Then buy me one. Kiki
But I think he's going to have a hard time
Let's go sledding together
But I think it's chilly now
"In winter, only snow, New Year's Day, and Christmas are good"
"Yes, what kind of ocean is it these days?"
"Even if I pay attention to it, it's up to you"
"I mean, act like you won't get in an accident."
How long does it take to Iksan by train?
I'm also thinking of walking around because the transportation fee is high.
So... you're going to get a ride?
"If that's the reason, you can sell it"
That's right. The subway doesn't get stuck and comes on time.
He totally destroyed the store
80% of the work is driving kiki
Bulls must have a car
"Oh, that's a relief"
"1,000 won is more expensive."
Phew... It's really scary in the morning
Do you have a reservation?
"Kiki, it's terrible to drive in your own car during rush hour in Seoul"
It takes 5 minutes by car and an hour by bus Kiki.
"Kiki, do you feel the need to take care of your health by studying a lot these days?"
Come to my house and ride 3000 times ^^
I envy you
"Before that, I'm replacing it with Americano."
Konjac rice sounds good
I'm going to eat tuna sashimi
My dad ate. Kiki
"I don't like cake, but it's really good"
Someone recommended that place!
What did you eat with the kids this morning?
"I drink soju when I bite it, too. Kiki"
I want Kyochon Honey Combo these days
I want to try Songgang Pizza
Did I screw it up? That's too bad
Jinoni wants to eat hot dogsafter all
"I was worried because there was only a rain forecast, but fortunately, it was sunny and rainy only at night Hah!"
I'm so jealous
"Yes, I'm just going to eat meat and noodles"
No Brand Potato Chip
But it's not braised hairtail but braised mackerel
The forest fire cut off electricity nearby
"Since I got a vaccine, it's okay if I wear a mask ^^~"
"Of course, it's a price that ordinary people like us can't even imagine"
I think you'll have a lot to worry about
That's right. Japan saves everything if you give them disaster support funds
That's right. It's military culture that you have to peel it.
"Maybe it's because the voting method is too old, but the rigged elections are bad. There are a lot of invalid votes, too"
I'm thankful that I was born in Korea
Is it a vaccine made in Spain?
Kiki is a funny person.
"I made it quickly, so I can't help it"
I wish I had a MacBook.
"Yes, in the end, emerging economies will have to keep falling behind"
I think I learned about the world economy again today.
"If you buy a meal, I'll go too."
I guess the plane was damaged and the flight was delayed
That's amazing.
I heard it topped the charts in the world
"It's been a while since I saw a romance cartoon, and I was so excited"
Iron Man suit ** Buy me one too
"Well, I don't know. I enjoyed watching cartoons"
I'm looking at my name these days Kiki.
I think I get a lot of tidings and stuff like that
It's okay because there's not much to my life. LOL. For no reason
I guess I have a definite taste in webtoons.
"Oh, no, don't cry"
I'll make you want to eat it
I watched it on set when I was in middle school
See you tomorrow and on the weekend
Look at both for me
"Right, I love Jungwoo Ha. They won't marry me"
I feel like the movie is becoming a reality
I didn't watch it when I was in middle and high school
There was a bit of a drowsy sexiness. LOL
"Yes, that's right. Webtoons are fun"
Is there anything to watch these days?
"When Kiki gets married, you feel free"
My mother is a flower arrangement instructor. Ha ha.
That's why I feel comfortable being an only child
I don't know if I should have a grandson at this time
"I don't really remember, but I didn't do well because I performed"
That's true. I do keep a diary too
I need to make it special
Kiki. Why are you fighting?
My son has a memorial service for his grandmother this Saturday.
My mother-in-law called me to say that she's doing well
Why is my mom in such a bad mood today?
I'm so excited
Let's talk every day from today
It's been a long time since we hung out together
Rice is rice. Please cut me some slack
The taste is different haha
Do you play well?
"I rely on my family a lot, so I think about it as I get older."
I like one and I don't like the other
"Yes, I went to my friend's house last time and my mom said she's raising him"
I live for 10-15 years haha
It's annoying
I heard hamster is really loud at night because he's active at night
"But if you don't touch me, I keep asking for your hand"
"As expected, cats grow fast"
I guess he got better soon because he put so much effort into it
There must be a lot of stray cats
I guess Kiki Buddy plays well in the mud flat too haha
Hello. Give me food Well said
Did you say that your brother has a dog?
Do you know that Cho Seungwoo has a dog?
There are a lot of people who walk without big dog muzzles despite the controversy
"Look at this, kiki"
Or the dog doesn't think of you as its owner
I've already watched it all. I'm watching a seahorse and a squid
My cat threw up
"Haha, that's right. I wonder what I did at that age"
Do you watch any dramas these days? Kiki.
I really enjoyed watching webtoons and dramas haha

Dr. Ha doesn't even know his real name haha;
Baseball players are good at golf
It's crazy because of the squid game on Netflix
"It's been a while since I've been working and making money, so I've been watching TV programs Kiki."
I'm totally soft. Have you seen the squid game? emoticon
"Yes, I enjoy golf and I get paid"
I beat Kang Hodong. The radio star is Kiki
Um... Kanzawa Naoki?
"That's true. Since it came out when I was in middle school, I must have listened to it."

Who was the actor there?
I guess it's Dolsing
Then look for filmography.
I heard you're already over 50
It didn't come off when I put the holder on
Really? Ask me anything.
"That's right. I put down a cup of coffee and sat on the terrace and watched the forest, and it looked so good"
Then it's a good one

Let's just call a helper
Are you building a new one?
It's 4.9 billion won.

He said he reflected on his son
I'm looking forward to the presidential candidates this time haha
"Wow, it's no joke"
"Yes, there are many inconveniences."
"A guy with a good-looking face, a criminal record of 35"
There are a lot of people who don't like Moon Jae Ins
I can't even do hobbies.
What? My friend didn't pay me back. Why are you doing that to my friend?
"But if it's on the news, isn't it supposed to come out when it's big? crying"
Maybe he reported it too. Hah!
**I'm glad I put off my bridal shower
"Lightning Man, it's been a while."
I shouldn't be that kind of person
Wouldn't the people who go as soon as it opens live for three years instead of three days?
Jo Jubin got it for 42 years
"Oh, I know. I want you to lock the ones that didn't reconnect""T"""
"When I see things like this, I suddenly don't like eating"
Everyone got it except my dad
"I know... If it doesn't fit, it hurts and I can't move"
I guess it's because I often order delivery food because I'm scared to go outside
Right? I fell while looking at my phone
I like meat. That's a relief
I just took Eastern Insurance
I should buy a lactobacillus later Me too
"Yes, I'll take this tooth out for you, too. LOL"
I think so. Kiki's daily life is so bad!
"Oh, my throat tastes like blood"
What kind of allergies do you have?
"I know, but I can't do it"
Yeah haha hand sanitizer small thing was rolling around
"If you feel any dirt, you should go to the hospital!"
I'm being careful not to catch a cold
Do you want to go with your daughter?
You have to take care of your health
It's not good for your health. Ventilate it
"For family peace, I'm eating without saying a word"
I guess Sulwhasoo's sales decreased a lot
There's a real check villain
Used goods aren't sold. It's hard
Don't you think I can't wear it because it's stuffy? You have to look forward. LOL
"In the case of fresh food, Jeju Island doesn't deliver it even if you pay for it."
Should I ask the owner for a refund?
I think it'll be so pretty
"Oh, is it bright? That's Kiki"
"I don't ask if you bought it with my money. But you know, right? Kiki."
"Right, carrots. Everything is weird"
But there are cases where you pay for a part-time job.
"Yes, use your money wisely"
E-Mart also has an app?
Really? But you don't have any place to use it
But the size was too small. It tasted good
"If you live like me, you can't work"
All the way? That's a little too much

Where is your most memorable travel destination?
Ah... Foot volleyball day... Ha ha.
"Yeosu is close to Jeolla-do, so I went there often"
am i depressed i don't feel depressed
i don't feel depressed i just don't like my brain anymore on normal mode
i don't feel sadness exactly but instead this horrible grey feeling
atleast i don't feel depressed on reddit so i keep it active just because so many of my friends use it and i want to keep up to date
i think there are a lot of people who don't feel sad all the time
i am considering talking to my doctor or a counselor about this but realistically i feel like they won't believe me that i don't feel depressed
i don't feel sad nor do i feel happy
i don't feel depressed but i spend all my time home alone
but here's the strange thing it doesn't really bother me i don't feel depressed about it
i don't feel depressed like most people on here who lack motivation or feel satisfied for completing something as simple as getting out of bed
well shit buddy don't feel sad about it
i don't feel sad or depressed but i act like i did when i was
these are all classic signs of depression but i just don't feel sadness or depressed at all
it's great to hear that you don't feel sad at the moment definitely a step in the right direction
when i've taken codeine i feel like i can concentrate i feel more creative and i don't feel depressed
the daft thing is i don't feel depressed so i just need to know if anyone has gone through this and is it 'normal' to have this
i don't feel sad but tired
there's a definite difference between the death i think about not depressed and wanting to die when i am depressed
i don't feel depressed yet my doctor said i was when it started giving me headaches i took antidepressants for  weeks and then quit because of some allergy
i don't feel depressed as far as i know
worst thing is that i don't feel depressed i actually feel fine except for my wife wanting to examine reexamine and over analyse every facet of my behavior
i really don't feel sad anymore but i am still not feeling well enough where i can actually get myself motivated to do something
i don't even generally feel sad annoyed maybe but not sad
while i don't feel depressed at this moment i do get short periods in the night where i wake and feel depressed
sometimes i don't feel sad for a day a week once even for a month but it always comes back as heavy as it was before
i don't feel depressed anymore and i've been happier than ever
i don't feel depressed though just very bored
i don't feel sad and depressed i just feel cold and emotionless
i don't feel depressed yet i've been depressed for yrs
i am not sad mad angry pissed off i am depressed
feel any emotion i don't feel sad or happy or angry
any relationships i create when i am not depressed disappear when i become depressed again which leads me to feeling lonely which increases the period of which i am depressed
i don't feel depressed but i don't feel happy
some days i just can't tell i don't feel sad but i give less of a fuck
i really don't feel sad all the time or feel like life just sucks because lately it's been looking up for me
i don't feel sad i just don't really feel
but i noticed that i don't feel sad now
i am depressed but i am not depressed enough for anyone to care or help
the thing is that i don't feel sad or guilty and i don't anger easily
i can almost pinpoint when it started but lately i just don't feel sad
if you're really unsure then maybe you could tell them you don't feel depressed professionals can get it wrong too
i don't feel sad or happy sometimes angry at things other people do but rarely
once again i don't feel depressed i have no suicidal thoughts
